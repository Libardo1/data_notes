### Introduction
The probability of default, as one of the key risk parameters in the IRB approach, has many methodologies for its estimation. In general, we can classify the existing methodologies into three groups: 
- structural models **(this paper focus on this kind of models)**, 
- reduced-form
models, 
- and credit-scoring (statistical)models.

Structural models were first introduced by Robert Merton in 1974 largely as a logicl extension of the Black-Scholes option pricing framework in 1973. He introduced a model for assessing the credit risk of a company by characterizing a company's equity as a derivative on its assets.
