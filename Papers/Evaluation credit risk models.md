## Introduction

The question of evaluating the accuracy of credit risk models has been a problem for both banks and regulators. To address this issue the authors propose evaluation methods based on cross-sectional simulation. Specifically, models are evaluated not only on their forecasts over time, but also on their forecasts at a given point in time for simulated credit portfolios.

*Credit risk is defined as the degree of value fluctuations in debt instruments and derivatives due to changes in the underlying credit quality of borrowers and counterparties.*

A major impediment to model validation (or “backtesting” as it is popularly known) is the small number of forecasts available with which to evaluate a model’s forecast accuracy. [This means, that the number of positive, or defaulted companies is allways smaller than the population. This bias influences both the modelization and the evaluation of the model and needs to be address by the modeler].
